*What are the effects of a career break related to motherhood on women's wages?*

### Abstract

Based on the research conducted by @hotchkiss_female_2005, our focus is on the wage income of women who have experienced a professional career interruption by one or more absences of more than one year due to maternity.

This particular career path is referred to as intermittent and exemplifies a three-phase model that encompasses a period of interruption between two active periods in the labor market. Therefore, we are led to divide the female population into two sectors, namely the continuous and intermittent sectors.

According to the study conducted by @hotchkiss_female_2005, it has been observed that a wage penalty for women in the intermittent sector is widely acknowledged within the research community, in contrast to those in the continuous sector. Nonetheless, its magnitude remains a matter of debate and requires determination.

Furthermore, it is probable that this disparity in wages will exert an impact on the selection of a career path and on the decision to participate or not in the labor force. This influence may vary based on the sociocultural characteristics of each individual. We will attempt to answer these questions for Swiss women, in contrast to the study by @hotchkiss_female_2005, which tested them for American women.

Kindly refer to the thesis submitted by @pipoz_du_2015 for further details. It is also available in English thanks to the Academia translator.
