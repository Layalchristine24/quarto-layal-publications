*Is it possible to balance the medium-term financing of OASI pensions while preserving benefit levels in the OASI stabilization project?*

# Summary

The @ofasbsvfsio_botschaft_2019 prepared this message, which was adopted by the Swiss Federal Council on August 28, 2019. 

Together with the mathematicians from the [FSIO](https://www.bsv.admin.ch/bsv/en/home.html), I contributed to this document by modeling and producing the various variants of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) financial budget in R.

These variants are featured on the last pages of the document.
