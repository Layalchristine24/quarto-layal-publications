*How to disentangle the total causal effect of a continuous treatment on an outcome into natural direct and indirect effects using the generalized propensity score?*

# Summary

@huber_direct_2020 propose in this article semi- and nonparametric methods for disentangling the total causal effect of a continuous treatment on an outcome variable into its natural direct effect and the indirect effect that operates through one or several intermediate variables or mediators.

@huber_direct_2020 have an approach which is based on weighting observations by the inverse of two versions of the generalized propensity score (GPS), namely the conditional density of treatment either given observed covariates or given covariates and the mediator.

@huber_direct_2020 show that the effect estimators are asymptotically normal when the GPS is estimated by either a parametric or a nonparametric kernel-based method. A simulation study and an application to the Job Corps program is also provided.
