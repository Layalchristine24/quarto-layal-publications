*Is the Swiss Trade Union's plan for a thirteenth monthly pension, while safeguarding supplementary benefits, effectively countering the declining AVS replacement rate and occupational pension concerns?*

# Summary

The @botschaft_treize_2022 prepared this message, which was adopted by the Swiss Federal Council on May 25, 2022.

Together with the mathematicians from the [FSIO](https://www.bsv.admin.ch/bsv/en/home.html), I contributed to this document by modeling and producing the various variants of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) financial budget in R.

These variants are featured on the last pages of the document.
