*Is the Mathematics Section of FSIO's new OASI budget calculation tool, implemented in R software and validated by external experts, comprehensive, based on plausible assumptions, and consistent between documentation and code, ready to support potential OASI financing system reforms?*

# Summary
As part of its \"Phoenix\" project, the Mathematics Section of the [FSIO](https://www.bsv.admin.ch/bsv/en/home.html) is responsible, among other things, for the development and re-implementation of the calculation of the OASI budget in the short and long term. This has recently been implemented with the R software. This new tool allows for the flexible projection of long-term pension amounts. With a view to a new reform of the OASI financing system, it is therefore essential to have reliable estimates of the OASI budget. 

With this in mind, the [FSIO](https://www.bsv.admin.ch/bsv/en/home.html) decided to have its pension modelling validated by external experts. @donze_expertise_2018 has been commissioned to do this. Throughout this appraisal, @donze_expertise_2018 has benefited from the help, explanations and comments of Layal Pipoz, a member of the Mathematics Section of the Federal Social Insurance Office ([FSIO](https://www.bsv.admin.ch/bsv/en/home.html)). In particular, the model for the long-term calculation of expenditures and revenues must be validated according to:

1. the completeness of the model;

2. the parametrisation and plausibility of the model's assumptions

3. the implementation in computer code, in particular from the point of view of the consistency
between the documentation and the code.
