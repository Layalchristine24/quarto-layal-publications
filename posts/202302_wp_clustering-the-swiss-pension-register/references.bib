	abstract = {The anonymous data of the Swiss Pension Register (CCO/FSIO) (PR) are typically used to estimate (in the short, middle and long term) the future revenues and expenditures of the Old-Age and Survivors’ Insurance (OASI). In this perspective, it is essential to have a clear look at the register’s main statistical features. To better understand it and benefit more from its richness, we propose analysing the raw data by an appropriate clustering method.},
