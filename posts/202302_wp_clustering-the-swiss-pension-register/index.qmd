*How can the diverse data of the Swiss Pension Register be clustered and analyzed to understand the sociodemographic characteristics of OASI pensioners and their implications for estimating future OASI finances?*

The anonymous information from the Swiss Pension Register (CCO/FSIO) (PR) is typically used to estimate (in the short, middle, and long term) the future revenues and expenditures of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI).

In this perspective, it is essential to have a clear look at the register's main statistical features. In order to gain a deeper comprehension of the data and maximize its richness, @lettry_clustering_2023 suggest analyzing the raw data using a suitable clustering technique.
